        <p>Tired of looking for trusty Pet Grooming Services? Look no further. Happy Paws now offers Pet Grooming Service Nepal to treat your dogs 
          to luxurious treatments. Grooming your pets is something that needs to be done routinely and on-time to maintain your pet’s health and sanitation.</p>
          <p>However, Happy Paws knows how tough it may be to locate a Dog Grooming in Kathmandu. That is why Happy Paws has teamed up with a variety of pet grooming providers to handle all of your pet's grooming needs.
             Their qualifications and experience ensure that your furry babies receive only the best grooming services.</p>
             <p>As of today, Happy Paws' Dog Grooming Services partners provide a wide range of services for your dogs' hygiene and cleanliness.
                Dogs are adorable, but they can also be rather dirty. However, failing to properly care for them might have a negative impact on their quality of life. 
                It can also make certain pre-existing medical disorders worse. So, here are some special Happy Paws services:</p>
                <h3>* Nail Trimming</h3>
               <p>Dog grooming services include a lot of nail clipping. The nails of a dog grow, and if they are not clipped properly or in a timely manner, they can grow wildly and curl.
                  This causes discomfort to the dogs and may even puncture their paws. Such events can lead to the dogs contracting more unpleasant ailments. A nail clipper is used to trim your nails.
                   Inexperienced users, on the other hand, might inflict harm to the dog when using it. As a result, expert nail cutting is recommended to keep your dog quiet and relaxed.</p>
                   <h4>* Dog Bath</h4>
                 <p>Do you want your dog to be clean, but you don't have the time or the space in your backyard for a dog grooming service?
                    Happy Paws dog grooming in Kathmandu provides luxurious baths for even the largest of canines. 
                    The wash stations are large and well-maintained. They also have a variety of soaps and washes based on the coat and the dog's cleanliness needs.
                     Even when drying agitated dogs, our trained groomers handle them expertly. 
                   Your pet will appreciate you for the exotic experience and have great shining fur!</p>
                   <h5>* Haircuts</h5>
                      <p>We all like to change up our appearance, but have you ever considered giving your dog a new look? 
                        Happy Paws partners, on the other hand, have created some very beautiful haircuts for all breeds of dogs. 
                        Haircuts aren't only fashionable; they're also a good method to care for your pet's coat.
                         Shi Tzus, for example, require pet grooming services so that they can see better. 
                         Other dogs, such as spaniels, huskies, and lhasa apsos, require regular haircuts as well. 
                        Style it according to your own personal preferences and watch your dog go from a bundle of fur to a high-class darling!</p>
                        <h6>* Hand Stripping</h6>
                         <p>In Kathmandu, hand stripping is an uncommon but necessary dog grooming service. It entails removing dead hair from the coat to make way for younger, stronger hair to grow in its place. The technique is meticulously carried out by experienced groomers' deft fingertips. For hairy, non-shedding dogs, this is the ideal form of dog grooming service.</p>
